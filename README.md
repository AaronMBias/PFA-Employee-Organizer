# PFA-Employee-Organizer

This was made for the final project in the class Database I during my sophomore year (2020) at Florida Polytechnic University. It was a group project, and my teammate was another Florida Polytechnic student Frank Bafford [1].

We were tasked with developing a database and a Java application to interface with the database for a fictional company.

## Launch
Compile and run from Main.java in the source directory. The application requires the user to input their MySQL username and password to connect to the database.
